# Algorithms
    - A repo for code files that have solutions to popular web pages algorithm questions like Leetcode or algoExpert. There is also a section for cracking the coding interview.
## Notes
    - I tried to include the prompts for each question so there are going to be spelling errors and typos as I typed the prompt as a read it to better understand it.
    - Most Tree/Graph problems do not include the promt or a test case to run them on as their test environments are usually set up differently than how I would set it up.
